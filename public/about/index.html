Here you'll find a collection of my about.<h1 id=about1>ABOUT1</h1><p>2024-02-23 <img alt src=https://img.0pt.icu/learn/linux-trip/4/mydesktop.jpg><p><em>This is my arch linux.</em><p><img alt src=https://img.0pt.icu/learn/linux-trip/5/1.jpg><p><em>This is my NixOS</em><h2 id=about-me>About Me</h2><p>Hey there, I'm a computer science student. I dig rock music, Linux, and all things intriguing.<h2 id=my-philosophy>My Philosophy</h2><p>Go with the flow and do what I love. Typically, I'm into efficient stuff; they keep everything running smoothly. However, sometimes I enjoy things that don't appear efficient at all. It's a whole different vibe, my quirky way of life.<h2 id=foundations>Foundations</h2><p><code>Arch Linux</code> is my go-to system on my personal computer, and I absolutely love it. It performs like a champ. Just a heads up, I roll with <code>EndeavourOS</code> for more convenient NVIDIA GPU support.<p><code>Hyprland</code> is my window manager. I used <code>KDE</code> before, also a top-notch desktop environment with loads of ecosystem support, but I prefer <code>Hyprland</code> for its simplicity and customization.<p><code>Waybar</code> sits atop my screen, keeping me informed.<p><code>Zsh</code> is my shell, paired with plugins for an enhanced experience.<p><code>Kitty</code> is my terminal. Chose it for better image support. Also, I might throw Alacritty on my machine too.<p><code>Paru</code> is my AUR helper, written in Rust, and it rocks.<h2 id=my-apps>My Apps</h2><p><code>Yazi</code> is my terminal file manager, crafted in Rust.<p><code>Rofi</code> is my app launcher.<p><code>Brave</code> is my browser, while Firefox is my backup browser.<p><code>Neovim</code> is my text editor. Learning it and trying to make it my go-to for everything.<p><code>Code-OSS</code> assists me with larger projects. Opted for it over VSCodium for no reason other than I just prefer it.<p>BetterBird is my email client, an enhanced version of Thunderbird.<p>Anytype is my note-taking and planning software. It uses blockchain technology for surprisingly fast sync speeds and is feature-packed. Anytype for everything.<p>Keepassxc keeps my passwords safe.<h1 id=about2>ABOUT2</h1><p>2024-12-20<h2 id=about-me-1>About Me</h2><p>Hey there, I'm a computer science student. I dig rock music, Linux, BSD, and all things intriguing.<h2 id=my-philosophy-1>My Philosophy</h2><p>Against The Philosophy of Struggling in Linux. From the Perspective of Needs, While Maintaining Curiosity and Exploration Towards New Things.<h2 id=foundations-1>Foundations</h2><p><code>FreeBSD</code> is my main system, and it's outstanding. It has a vast number of packages, is secure and stable, and can last for 50 years (just kidding üòÅ). I will spare no words in praising FreeBSD.<p><code>NixOS</code> is another primary system for me. It has powerful features and is reproducible. It‚Äôs the most stable Linux I‚Äôve ever encountered, and unlike Debian, it doesn't suffer from a lack of old packages.<p><code>Hyprland</code> is my window manager. I used <code>KDE</code> before, also a top-notch desktop environment with loads of ecosystem support, but I prefer <code>Hyprland</code> for its simplicity and customization.<p><code>Waybar</code> sits atop my screen, keeping me informed.<p><code>Nushell</code> is my shell. It‚Äôs written in Rust and comes with many modern features.<p><code>Kitty</code> is my terminal. Chose it for better image support. Also, I might throw Alacritty on my machine too.<h2 id=my-apps-1>My Apps</h2><p><code>Yazi</code> is my terminal file manager, crafted in Rust.<p><code>Rofi</code> is my app launcher.<p><code>Brave</code> is my browser, while Firefox is my backup browser.<p><code>Neovim</code> is my text editor.
