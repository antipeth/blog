Welcome to my about section. Here you'll find a collection of my about.

## About Me

Hey there, I'm a computer science student. I dig rock music, Linux, BSD, open source and all things intriguing.

## My Philosophy

Against The Philosophy of Struggling. From the Perspective of Needs, While Maintaining Curiosity and Exploration Towards New Things.

## My Software Ecosystem
`NixOS` is my main operating system — it powers my desktop, NAS and servers.I express almost every piece of software, service, and configuration I need as Nix code. Everything is explicitly defined, declarative, and 100% reproducible.The side effect? I’ve become suspiciously lazy sometimes… things just work and I barely have to touch them anymore. 💤

`Niri` is my current window manager.What hooked me is its unique scrolling-tiling layout logic — it feels different and surprisingly pleasant once you adapt. Bonus: also written in Rust.

`Waybar` sits atop my screen, keeping me informed.

`Nushell` is my shell. It’s written in Rust and comes with many modern features.

`Alacritty` is my terminal emulator.I consider it the fastest terminal available right now — and that alone is enough reason for me to use it.

`Yazi` is my terminal file manager, crafted in Rust.

`Fuzzel` is my app launcher.

`Brave` is my browser, while `Floorp` is my backup browser.

`Zed` and `Neovim` are my text editor.

`Thunderbird` is my email and calendar client.

`Joplin` is my note-taking and planning software.

`Keepassxc` keeps my passwords safe.

`Strawberry` is my music player.
